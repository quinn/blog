title: new website up contactjam.com, built using rails 3
---

Exciting news, my friend Kevin (http://www.linkedin.com/pub/kevin-incorvia/20/339/508/) just launched an alpha of his new site: http://contactjam.com. Cool! In a nutshell it is a "foursquare" that also ties in the time and the locale of other people. Its really neat, but I don't want to give too much away because it is still in a closed alpha. I had the privilege of building the first iteration using rails 3, datamapper, and deploying it on aws using ec2 and s3. I'll keep you posted with updates about it as it develops.
