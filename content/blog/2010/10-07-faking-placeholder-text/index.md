title: faking placeholder from html5 in jquery
---

I just coded up a simple plugin to enable placeholder text for inputs in browsers that don't support it yet. This isn't tested thoroughly, please let me know if anything isn't working properly!

Check it out on github: http://github.com/quinn/jquery.placeholder.js
